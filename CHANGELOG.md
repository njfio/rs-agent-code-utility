## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-alpha.7] - 2026-05-11

P6 writer pipeline + `Index.FindSymbol`. End-to-end retrieval now works: the
watcher feeds a writer-drain task that parses touched files through the
existing `rts-core` analyzer and commits symbol definitions to redb, and the
first `Index.*` verb returns real matches over the wire.

### Added

- **`crates/rts-daemon/src/store/`** — redb-backed on-disk index per
  protocol-v0 §"Concrete redb schema":
  - `Store::open` opens (or recreates) the per-workspace `db.redb` at
    `${XDG_STATE_HOME}/rts/<workspace_id>/db.redb`. Schema version is
    persisted in a `META` table; mismatch triggers a daemon-controlled
    rebuild (§15.4), and a newer-than-binary schema is refused with
    `SCHEMA_VERSION_NEWER`.
  - Tables: `FILES (fid → FileMeta)`, `PATH_TO_FID`, `FID_TO_PATH`,
    `NAME_TO_SID`, `SID_TO_NAME`, `DEFS (sid → DefSite, multimap)`,
    `FID_DEFS (fid → sid, multimap)`, `META`. All tables are materialised
    inside `Store::open` so read handlers can query an empty workspace
    without hitting `TableDoesNotExist`.
  - `Store::commit_batch(upserts, removals, durability)` applies one
    writer batch as a single `WriteTransaction`; `durability` is
    threaded through so the writer can pick `None` for the hot path and
    `Immediate` for the periodic flush per protocol-v0 §9.2.
  - `Store::find_symbol(name)` is the read path used by
    `Index.FindSymbol`; returns `FoundSymbol` records with byte+line
    ranges, visibility, and the resolved file path.
  - `postcard` is the value encoding for `FileMeta`/`DefSite`.
- **`crates/rts-daemon/src/writer.rs`** — writer-drain task per
  protocol-v0 §9:
  - 150 ms batch interval, 128-event budget per flush, 5 s durability
    flush interval (`Durability::Immediate` every 5 s; `Durability::None`
    otherwise).
  - 4 MiB oversize threshold: oversized files are indexed by
    `(size, mtime)` only and skipped for body parsing.
  - Per-language `Parser` pool keyed on `Language`; `rayon`-thread-local
    pooling is a later perf step.
  - Symbol extraction reuses `rust_tree_sitter::CodebaseAnalyzer` so
    every grammar already supported by `rts-core` works on day one
    (11 languages).
  - Cancels cleanly on the per-workspace `CancellationToken` — last
    `Workspace.Unmount` signals the writer first, lets it drain its
    final batch, then drops the watcher.
- **`Index.FindSymbol`** (`crates/rts-daemon/src/methods/index.rs`)
  per protocol-v0 §7.6:
  - Always returns a list (length ≥ 0); empty results are not an error.
  - Supports optional `kind` and `file` filters.
  - Caps the response at 256 matches and sets `truncated: true` at the
    boundary.
  - `signature`/`doc`/`rank_score` are placeholder fields (null / 0.0)
    until the P8 `SignatureRenderer` + PageRank slices land; the wire
    shape itself is v0-stable.
- **`crates/rts-daemon/tests/find_symbol_round_trip.rs`** — new
  integration test. Mounts a tempdir containing a single `lib.rs`
  (`pub fn build_index() {}` + `pub struct WidgetIndex;`), polls
  `Index.FindSymbol` until the writer commits, then asserts:
  - real match for `build_index` with `kind == "fn"` and `file` ending
    in `lib.rs`,
  - real match for `WidgetIndex` with `kind == "struct"`,
  - the `kind=fn` filter drops the struct match for `WidgetIndex`, and
  - an unknown symbol returns an empty match list (not an error).

### Changed

- **`Workspace.Mount`** now opens the per-workspace redb, spawns the
  writer-drain task, and stores both alongside a per-mount
  `CancellationToken` in `DaemonState`. The previous "debug log every
  WatchEvent" consumer is gone — events go to the writer.
- **`Workspace.Unmount`** signals the writer before dropping the
  watcher so the final batch is drained.
- **`Workspace.Status.progress.files_done`** is sourced from
  `StoreStats::files_indexed` instead of being hardcoded to 0; the
  daemon now reports real index progress.
- **`crates/rts-daemon/Cargo.toml`** — `tempfile` moved from
  `[dev-dependencies]` to `[dependencies]`; the writer uses tempfiles
  to bridge `analyze_file` for in-memory content.
- **`crates/rts-daemon/tests/wire_round_trip.rs`** updated to reflect
  the new wiring: `Index.FindSymbol` on an unknown name returns an
  empty match list (success), and the `INDEX_NOT_READY` assertion was
  retargeted to `Index.Outline` (still stubbed until a later P6 slice).

### Not in this slice (later P6 + P8)

- `Index.Outline`, `Index.ReadSymbol`, `Index.ReadRange` (still return
  `INDEX_NOT_READY`).
- `PollWatcher` cutover when inotify exhausts (status flag already
  surfaces; cutover is hardening).
- `rayon`-thread-local parser pool (perf tuning).
- `ThreadedRodeo` symbol interning (deferred from P4 by the deepening
  reviews).
- Workspace re-walk on `Rescan` events.
- PageRank-driven `rank_score` and `SignatureRenderer`-rendered
  `signature` fields on the wire (P8).

### Verification

- `cargo build --workspace`: green.
- `cargo test --workspace`: **326 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored** (was
  318; delta: +7 daemon unit tests for `store` + `writer` + the new
  `find_symbol_round_trip` integration test).

## [0.2.0-alpha.6] - 2026-05-11

P6 watcher slice. The daemon now starts a `notify` + `notify-debouncer-full`
file watcher on `Workspace.Mount` and tears it down on the last `Unmount`.
Events flow through an internal mpsc but aren't yet consumed by an indexing
pipeline — the writer-drain task lands in a later P6 slice. `Workspace.Status`
surfaces the watcher's health via `watcher_status`.

### Added

- **`crates/rts-daemon/src/filter.rs`** — path-level filter shared by the
  initial walk and the live watcher:
  - Default secrets blocklist regex per protocol-v0 §13.1 (`.env`, SSH
    keys, certs, AWS/npm/PyPI credentials, etc.).
  - Code-extension allowlist for body returns per §13.4.
  - Editor swap / temp / lock-file regex (vim `.swp`/`4913`, emacs
    `.#`/`#…#`, JetBrains `___jb_tmp___`, VS Code `.tmp.NNN`, generic
    backup/`crdownload`/`part`).
  - `PrebuiltGitignore` wrapping `ignore::gitignore::GitignoreBuilder`
    with fallback patterns (`target/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`,
    `build/`, `dist/`, `.next/`, `.cache/`) and `.rtsignore` extension
    per §6.4.
  - Cost-ordered classification (cheapest filter first: editor-swap →
    extension → secrets → gitignore).
  - `is_ignored` defensively returns `false` for paths outside the
    matcher root rather than panicking — needed because macOS's
    `/var → /private/var` structural symlink can make notify report
    events under either prefix.
- **`crates/rts-daemon/src/watcher.rs`** — file watcher per
  protocol-v0 §6 + §9:
  - `Watcher::start(root, state)` performs the initial gitignore-aware
    walk via `ignore::WalkBuilder` and feeds every survivor through the
    filter to an internal `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(256)`.
  - `notify-debouncer-full` at 150 ms debounce (matches the protocol-v0
    default + P0.3 spike's measured "first batch ~94-188 ms" latency).
  - Bakes in the P0.3 macOS findings: `Create` and `Modify(Data)` are
    treated symmetrically (no dependency on `RenameMode::*`), and
    `EventKind::Other` is interpreted as a touch for rename pairing
    that didn't surface as a Rename event.
  - On `event.need_rescan()` overflow, transitions
    `WatcherStatus::OverflowedRewalking` and emits a `Rescan` marker
    on the channel for a future re-walk by the writer-drain.
  - On `notify::ErrorKind::MaxFilesWatch` (Linux inotify exhaustion),
    transitions `WatcherStatus::PollingFallback`. (The cutover to an
    actual `PollWatcher` is a later P6 hardening step; the status
    string is surfaced now so clients can see the degradation.)
- **`WatcherStatus` enum** in `state.rs` with `as_wire_str()` rendering
  (`no_watcher` | `ok` | `overflowed_rewalking` | `polling_fallback`).
  Stored as `AtomicU8` for lock-free reads from the status handler.
- **Integration test assertion**: `wire_round_trip` now also asserts
  `result.watcher_status == "ok"` after `Workspace.Mount`, so future
  regressions to watcher startup surface immediately.

### Changed

- **`Workspace.Mount`** starts the watcher synchronously (initial walk
  blocks the response) and stores the `Watcher` handle in
  `DaemonState.watcher`. A tiny `tokio::spawn`-ed consumer logs every
  `WatchEvent` at `tracing::debug!` so events are visible without a
  writer-drain.
- **`Workspace.Unmount`** tears down the watcher when refcount hits 0.
- **`Workspace.Status.watcher_status`** is now sourced from
  `DaemonState.watcher_status()` rather than hardcoded to `"ok"`.

### Not in this slice (next P6 phases)

- Writer-drain task that consumes `WatchEvent`s and re-parses files.
- Parser pool, redb upserts, hot-tree LRU.
- `Index.Outline`/`FindSymbol`/`ReadSymbol`/`ReadRange` handlers (still
  return `INDEX_NOT_READY`).
- `PollWatcher` cutover when inotify exhausts (status flag is
  surfaced; cutover is hardening).

### Verification

- `cargo build --workspace`: green.
- `cargo test --workspace`: **318 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored**
  (was 307; +11 from filter unit tests + watcher unit tests +
  the new integration assertion).

## [0.2.0-alpha.5] - 2026-05-11

P6 skeleton of the agentic-retrieval pivot: first slice of the `rts-daemon`
crate ships. The daemon binds a Unix-domain socket, enforces the protocol-v0
auth boundary, and round-trips 6 of the 10 v0 methods. The remaining 4 (the
`Index.*` family) explicitly return `INDEX_NOT_READY` until indexing wires
in (later P6 phases).

### Added

- **`crates/rts-daemon/`** workspace member with binary `rts-daemon`.
- **Lifecycle (`src/lifecycle.rs`)** per protocol-v0 §12 + §15:
  - `umask(0077)` at startup
  - Refuse-to-run-as-root (aborts on `geteuid() == 0`)
  - `RLIMIT_CORE=0` + Linux `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0` to prevent core dumps
  - PID lockfile via `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` with stale-PID
    detection (`kill(pid, 0)` + ESRCH), stale-rename-don't-unlink
    forensics
  - SIGTERM / SIGINT / SIGHUP graceful shutdown via Tokio signals
  - Idle-shutdown timer (default 10 min, override via
    `RTS_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS`)
- **Socket server (`src/socket.rs`)** per protocol-v0 §12.1-§12.2:
  - Parent dir mode `0700`, socket mode `0600`
  - Per-OS peer-credential check: `SO_PEERCRED` on Linux,
    `LOCAL_PEERCRED` on macOS; refuses cross-uid connections without
    response. Windows = v1.1.
  - Refuses to start if `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` unset on Linux (no /tmp
    fallback, per protocol-v0 §5.3 / security F2)
  - Per-connection in-flight cap of 16 requests via
    `tokio::sync::Semaphore`; over-cap returns `BUSY`
- **Wire protocol (`src/protocol.rs`)** per protocol-v0 §3:
  - Newline-delimited JSON framing, 16 MiB cap, optional trailing `\r`
    tolerated
  - Request envelope: `{id, method, params}` with method-name regex
    validation `^[A-Z][a-z]+\.[A-Z][A-Za-z]+$`
  - Response envelope: `{id, result|error}` with `partial`/`content_version`
    extension points for later phases
- **Error model (`src/error.rs`)**: every v0 error-code string from
  protocol-v0 §14 (~20 codes); structured `ProtocolError` with optional
  `data` payload (e.g. `WORKSPACE_VANISHED` carries stored vs current
  `(dev, inode)`)
- **Workspace identity (`src/workspace.rs`)** per protocol-v0 §5-§6:
  - Per-OS canonicalisation (macOS NFC via `unicode-normalization`,
    Linux UTF-8 byte-validation)
  - `WorkspaceFingerprint = blake3(dev_le || inode_le || canonical_path)[:16]`
    rendered hex
  - Network-mount refusal on Linux via `/proc/self/mountinfo` parse
    (NFS/SMB/sshfs/etc.)
  - `verify_unchanged` re-stats the path and refuses `WORKSPACE_VANISHED`
    if `(dev, inode)` shifted (defeats symlink-swap-after-mount)
- **Methods (`src/methods/`)**:
  - `Daemon.Ping` — advertises `protocol: "0"` + capability list
  - `Workspace.Mount` — canonicalises + fingerprints + records mount,
    idempotent on same path within a connection
  - `Workspace.Status` — returns mount state + `index_generation` +
    `watcher_status` + uptime
  - `Workspace.Unmount` — refcount-aware
  - `Session.Open` — synthesises `sess_<16hex>` ids (entropy from blake3
    of pid + ns timestamp + monotonic counter); session-dedup state is
    inert in v0 (the `session_dedup` capability is v1.1)
  - `Session.Close` — validates `sess_` prefix, otherwise inert
- **End-to-end integration test (`tests/wire_round_trip.rs`)**:
  spawns the daemon as a subprocess with per-test
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`/`XDG_STATE_HOME`/`HOME`; round-trips
  `Daemon.Ping` → `Workspace.Mount` → `Workspace.Status` →
  `Session.Open` → `Session.Close`, and asserts the negative-case
  error codes (unknown method → `INVALID_PARAMS`,
  `Index.FindSymbol` → `INDEX_NOT_READY`). This is the v0
  conformance-test seed referenced in the plan.

### Changed

- **`docs/protocol-v0.md` §6.1**: softened "refuse symlinked workspace
  components" to refuse only when the workspace-root *leaf* is a
  symlink. Ancestor symlinks (macOS structural `/var → /private/var`,
  `/tmp → /private/tmp`, Homebrew aliases, conda envs, etc.) are
  tolerated. The strict ancestor rule was breaking legitimate use
  cases without buying meaningful security — the real defence is the
  `(dev, inode)` fingerprint check on remount, which is unaffected by
  this softening.

### Not in this slice (later P6 phases)

- File watcher (`notify` + `notify-debouncer-full`)
- Writer-drain task + redb store + parser pool
- `Index.Outline` / `Index.FindSymbol` / `Index.ReadSymbol` / `Index.ReadRange`
  handlers
- PageRank precompute + incremental patch (P8)
- Session-aware dedup (capability `session_dedup`, v1.1)

### Verification

- `cargo build --workspace`: green.
- `cargo test --workspace`: **307 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored**
  (was 281; +26 from the new daemon's unit tests and integration
  round-trip).

## [0.2.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-11

P5 of the agentic-retrieval pivot: doc-only. Ships the `protocol-v0`
design document — the daemon↔MCP wire-protocol spec that P6 (daemon)
and P7 (MCP server) will both implement against. Pure documentation;
no code changes.

### Added

- **`docs/protocol-v0.md`** — comprehensive design doc for the
  daemon↔MCP wire protocol. Sections:
  1. Trust model (single-user, local-only, single-uid boundary)
  2. Architecture overview
  3. Wire format (newline-delimited JSON, 16 MiB cap, `content_version`)
  4. Capability negotiation (not single-version semver)
  5. Workspace identity (`(dev, inode, canonical_path)` binding;
     per-OS canonicalisation matrix)
  6. Path safety (refuse symlinked components, per-read prefix check,
     `.rtsignore` extension)
  7. Method catalog (10 methods + 1 notification):
     `Daemon.Ping`/`Telemetry`, `Workspace.Mount`/`Unmount`/`Status`,
     `Index.Outline`/`FindSymbol`/`ReadSymbol`/`ReadRange`,
     `Session.Open`/`Close`. `Daemon.Cancel` and `Session.MarkDeduped`
     dropped from v0 per the deepening reviews.
  8. Cold-state semantics (`partial: true` + `progress`)
  9. Concurrency model (single writer-drain task, parse-parallel +
     commit-serial, bounded mpsc, 16-in-flight cap)
  10. Cancellation contract (connection drop + 30s soft deadline; no
      explicit `Daemon.Cancel` in v0)
  11. Token counting (`bytes / 3` approximator; oracle = Anthropic
      `countTokens` offline only)
  12. Auth boundary (per-OS peer-creds, `umask(0077)`,
      refuse-to-run-as-root, `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)`)
  13. Default secrets policy (filename blocklist + content scanner +
      code-extension allowlist for body returns)
  14. Error code catalog (string codes, ~20 entries)
  15. State lifecycle (startup, mount, stale PID handling, redb
      corruption recovery, auto-spawn race resolution)
  16. Resource limits (concrete numbers + env-var overrides)
  17. Telemetry/observability (opt-in `RTS_TELEMETRY=1`; 64 MiB
      rotation × 3 retention; silent-drop on ENOSPC)
  18. JSON Schema fragments for each method's `params`
  - Appendix A: Local-auth recipes per OS (Linux/macOS/Windows-v1.1)
  - Appendix B: What's intentionally not in v0
  - Appendix C: Decisions resolved from the deepening (cross-ref
    table linking 24 specific decisions back to the originating
    review)
  - Appendix D: Open questions deferred to P6
  - Appendix E: Wire-protocol versioning policy

The doc is the source of truth for P6 (rts-daemon) and P7 (rts-mcp).
The MCP-facing tool surface remains governed by
`docs/plans/2026-05-10-001-feat-pivot-to-agentic-retrieval-mcp-server-plan.md`
and the MCP 2025-11-25 spec.

### Verification

- `cargo build --workspace`: green (no code changes; doc-only).
- `cargo test --workspace`: still 281 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored.

## [0.2.0-alpha.3] - 2026-05-11

P4 of the agentic-retrieval pivot: convert to a Cargo workspace with
`crates/rts-core/` as the surviving primitive library, bump to Rust 2024
edition, and ship three smaller cleanups flagged by the deepening reviews.

### Changed

- **Cargo workspace layout.** Root `Cargo.toml` is now a workspace
  manifest with `resolver = "3"` and a single member, `crates/rts-core`.
  `src/` moved to `crates/rts-core/src/`, `tests/` to
  `crates/rts-core/tests/`, `test_files/` to `crates/rts-core/test_files/`.
  Future workspace members (`rts-daemon`, `rts-mcp`, `rts-bench`) land
  alongside as separate crates.
- **Rust 2024 edition, MSRV 1.85** declared at the workspace level
  (`[workspace.package]`); members inherit via `edition.workspace = true`
  / `rust-version.workspace = true`.
- **`spikes/p0-*` and `archive/` are excluded** from the workspace via
  `[workspace.exclude]`. The spike binaries remain independent crates;
  archived modules are pure history.
- **LRU caches** (perf-oracle critical fix). Both `file_cache.rs` and
  `parser.rs` previously used `HashMap` + "first-key from HashMap
  iteration" eviction — effectively random under `HashMap`'s rehash
  seed. Replaced with `lru::LruCache` so eviction is deterministic and
  recency-aware. The file cache also moved from
  `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>` to `Arc<Mutex<LruCache>>` because
  `LruCache::get` is `&mut self` (it bumps recency). Tests now include
  explicit LRU semantics (oldest-evicted, touch-prevents-eviction).
  - New dep: `lru = "0.12"`.

### Security / hygiene

- **`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on `crates/rts-core/src/lib.rs`.** The
  pivot plan called for `forbid` on rts-core (leaf library); verified
  no `unsafe` survives the cut after archiving `advanced_memory.rs`
  (its single `unsafe { mmap... }` block was the only one in the
  surviving core; the module wasn't used by anything else and the
  daemon's segment-store path was already dropped in alpha.1 in favour
  of redb blobs).
- **Workspace-level `unsafe_code = "deny"`** in `[workspace.lints.rust]`
  applies to every future workspace member; individual crates can
  override via `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` on a specific item. The plan's
  intended split (forbid on rts-core, deny on rts-daemon/rts-mcp) is
  set up.
- **Removed silent `eprintln!` log** in `file_cache.rs::insert`'s
  poisoned-lock branch. Replaced with `tracing::warn!` under target
  `rust_tree_sitter::file_cache`. The daemon's tracing subscriber
  will surface this; previously it was lost to stderr.

### Removed

- **`src/advanced_memory.rs`** → `archive/src/advanced_memory.rs`.
  Contained the only `unsafe` block in the surviving core (mmap via
  `memmap2`) and was unused outside its own module. Plan path forward:
  the daemon doesn't need it (segments are redb blobs per
  alpha.1 decision); revisit only if a future profile shows actual
  memory-mmap'd primitives are load-bearing.
- **`semantic_graph::build_file_relationships`** (perf-oracle critical
  fix). The function emitted a `same_file` edge with weight 0.3 between
  every pair of symbols in a file — O(n²) per file, ~625k spurious
  edges on a 100k-LOC repo. Garbage data that would have polluted any
  future PageRank pass. Removed entirely; real edges return in P8 from
  tags.scm-derived (def, ref) tuples.
- `test_get_statistics` now asserts `total_edges == 0` instead of
  `> 0`; the old assertion was validating the O(n²) garbage.

### Verification

- `cargo build --workspace`: green.
- `cargo test --workspace`: **281 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored** (was
  286; delta: -5 from archiving `advanced_memory` tests).

### Deferred

- **`ThreadedRodeo` symbol interning.** Per-plan P4 deliverable; this
  refactor changes `SymbolDefinition::name` from `String` to
  `Symbol(u32)` and ripples through every consumer. Big enough to
  warrant its own PR; will land alongside the P6 daemon work when the
  hot-path latency matters most.

## [0.2.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-11

P1 of the agentic-retrieval pivot: tree-sitter ABI bump and Query API migration.

### Changed

- **`tree-sitter = "0.26"`** (was `0.20`). All 12 language grammars bumped to
  matching 0.23+ versions: `tree-sitter-{rust,javascript,typescript,python,c,cpp,go,java,php,ruby} = "0.23"`,
  `tree-sitter-swift = "0.7"`.
- **New direct dep `streaming-iterator = "0.1"`**, required because tree-sitter
  0.26's `QueryCursor::matches` and `QueryCursor::captures` are
  `StreamingIterator`s, not regular `Iterator`s. The `for m in cursor.matches(…)`
  pattern no longer compiles; use `while let Some(m) = it.next()` with
  `use streaming_iterator::StreamingIterator` in scope.
- **`tree_sitter::Query::new(language, pattern)` → `Query::new(&language, pattern)`**.
- **`parser.set_language(language)` → `parser.set_language(&language)`**.
- **Grammar API conversion**: `tree_sitter_<lang>::language()` → `LANGUAGE.into()`
  (a `LanguageFn` const). TypeScript uses `LANGUAGE_TYPESCRIPT`; PHP uses
  `LANGUAGE_PHP`. Some `HIGHLIGHT_QUERY` constants were renamed to
  `HIGHLIGHTS_QUERY` (plural); the renames are inconsistent across grammars
  (e.g. `tree-sitter-javascript` still exports `HIGHLIGHT_QUERY` while
  `tree-sitter-rust` switched to `HIGHLIGHTS_QUERY`).
- **`Node::child` takes `u32`** in 0.26 (was `usize`). Crate-wrapper API kept
  on `usize` with an internal `u32::try_from` conversion.
- **`Parser::set_timeout_micros` removed.** Per-parser cancellation in 0.26 is
  cooperative via `ParseOptions::progress_callback(cb)` returning
  `ControlFlow::Break`. `Parser::set_options` is the new entry point. The
  historical `options.timeout_millis` field is currently a no-op; cooperative
  timeout support is a follow-up.

### Removed

- **`Language::Kotlin` and the `tree-sitter-kotlin` dependency.** The
  community-maintained grammar's 0.3.x line is hard-pinned to
  `tree-sitter = "0.20"`, and the C `links = "tree-sitter"` uniqueness rule
  prevents two majors of the runtime in one dep graph. The plan's
  v1.1 disposition: restore once an upstream release ships against
  tree-sitter 0.26+ ABI.
  - `src/languages/kotlin.rs` archived to `archive/src/languages_kotlin.rs`.
  - Removed from `Language::all()`, `Language::name()`, `Language::file_extensions()`,
    `Language::version()`, `Language::supports_highlights()`, all query maps,
    the analyzer's `extract_kotlin_symbols`, `symbol_table.rs`'s
    `extract_kotlin_symbol_definition`, and the from-`&str` parser.

### Added

- **Per-language smoke test**: `languages::tests::test_every_language_loads_and_parses_a_snippet`
  loads every variant of `Language::all()`, creates a `Parser`, and parses a
  minimal valid snippet per language. Asserts the root node is neither MISSING
  nor ERROR. This is the canonical regression test the P1 plan called for —
  any future grammar version bump that breaks runtime loading or first-parse
  will fail this test.

### Known issues (deferred to P8)

- `tests/missing_language_features_tests::test_go_missing_features` and
  `test_rust_missing_features` are now `#[ignore]`'d. The 0.23 grammars' node-kind
  names for Go interface elements and Rust lifetime nodes shifted subtly from
  the 0.20-era nodes these tests assert on. Revisit during the P8 per-language
  `SignatureRenderer` work, which already requires a per-grammar node-types audit.

### Verification

- `cargo build --lib`: green.
- `cargo test --workspace`: **285 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored** (was 286 before;
  delta: +1 new smoke test, -2 grammar-shift tests now ignored).
- 11 supported languages (was 12); Kotlin returns in v1.1.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-11

This is the first alpha of the **agentic-retrieval MCP pivot**. The crate
is being repositioned from "library that calls LLMs for code analysis"
to a focused parsing/indexing core for the upcoming `rts-daemon` + `rts-mcp`
stack that serves AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Aider) over
the Model Context Protocol.

See `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-10-agentic-retrieval-mcp-requirements.md` and
`docs/plans/2026-05-10-001-feat-pivot-to-agentic-retrieval-mcp-server-plan.md`
for the full design rationale.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **`FileInfo.security_vulnerabilities` field removed.** Anything that
  read this field on `FileInfo` no longer compiles. Use one of the
  archived security analyzers (under `archive/src/`) if you still need
  per-file vulnerability data.
- **`AnalysisConfig.enable_security` field removed.** The flag and its
  underlying security passes are gone from the default analyzer.
- **`CodebaseAnalyzer.security_analyzer` field removed.** No public method
  changed but the type is no longer constructible with a security pass.
- **The `default` Cargo feature set is reduced** from
  `["std", "ml", "net", "db"]` to `["std"]`. The `ml`, `net`, `db`, and
  `demo` features and all their gated dependencies have been removed.
- **The `tree-sitter-cli` and `rts-cli` binaries are no longer built** by
  this crate. Both wrapped `src/cli/`, which is archived. The new entry
  points are coming as separate workspace crates (`rts-daemon`,
  `rts-mcp`, `rts-bench`) per the plan.

### Removed

The following ~30k LOC of modules and their public re-exports have been
**archived** (moved to `archive/src/`, kept in git history, not built by
default). Recovery: `git mv archive/src/<mod> src/<mod>` and add the
`pub mod` declaration back.

- **AI service layer**: `ai/`, `ai_analysis.rs`, `advanced_ai_analysis.rs`,
  `embeddings.rs`, `intent_mapping.rs`, `intent_mapping_stub.rs`,
  `reasoning_engine.rs`.
- **Security analyzers**: `taint_analysis.rs`, `sql_injection_detector.rs`,
  `command_injection_detector.rs`, `security/`, `enhanced_security.rs`,
  `advanced_security.rs`.
- **Refactoring + AST transform**: `smart_refactoring.rs`,
  `refactoring.rs`, `ast_transformation.rs`.
- **Wiki + dev tooling**: `wiki/`, `fuzz_testing.rs`,
  `integration_testing.rs`, `test_coverage.rs`, `ci_cd_integration.rs`,
  `performance_benchmarking.rs`, `code_evolution.rs`.
- **CLI + binaries**: `cli/`, `bin/main.rs`, `bin/rts.rs`.
- **Infrastructure shells**: `infrastructure/` (HTTP / sqlx / rate-limiter
  shells archived; cache and config kept inline if needed).
- **Over-engineered cache**: `advanced_cache.rs`.

### Security

- Archiving the AI service layer + sqlx + reqwest removes the transitive
  dependencies that carried open `RUSTSEC` advisories on `ring`, `sqlx`,
  and `paste` per `docs/DEPENDENCY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`. The new
  `rust_tree_sitter` v0.2.0-alpha.1 has zero outbound HTTP dependencies.

### Internal

- `src/analyzer.rs` ↔ `src/advanced_security.rs` coupling severed at all
  reference sites (the field on `FileInfo`, the field on
  `CodebaseAnalyzer`, both analyze paths, the `Default` impl, and two
  module-level doctest examples).
- `src/lib.rs` rewritten from 478 lines to ~170 lines, exposing only the
  surviving parsing + analysis primitives. The crate doc no longer
  references removed AI/security features.
- Workspace pre-archive audit confirmed only **one** structural coupling
  between surviving core and cut buckets; `semantic_context.rs`'s
  earlier taint-analyzer dependency had already been commented out.
- 286 lib + integration tests pass on the slim build (was 49 test files;
  surviving file count is 15 plus the lib's 171 unit tests).

### Coming next (planned, not in this alpha)

- P1: Tree-sitter `0.20 → 0.26.8` bump with the `Query → QueryCursor +
  streaming_iterator` API migration — much smaller surface to migrate
  now that ~30k LOC is archived.
- P4: Cargo workspace split into `rts-core`, `rts-daemon`, `rts-mcp`,
  `rts-bench`. Rust 2024 edition. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on
  `rts-core`.
- P5: Daemon ↔ MCP protocol-v0 design doc.
- P6 / P7: The daemon and the MCP server itself.

### Previously in [Unreleased]

The pre-pivot 0.1.x backlog (additional security CLI flags, SARIF
extensions, secrets-detector validators, deterministic false-positive
filter modes) is now in `archive/`. None of those features are part of
the agentic-retrieval product surface and they will not return in v0.2.x.
