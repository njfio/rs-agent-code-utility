# Project Update: Wiki CLI Fix

## Summary
Fixed the `main.rs` file to enable CLI functionality. Previously, the main executable was only printing "Hello, world!" instead of processing command line arguments.

## Changes Made
- Updated `src/main.rs` to use clap CLI parser and execute commands
- Added proper imports for `clap::Parser` and `rust_tree_sitter::cli::Execute`
- Fixed module path resolution from `crate::cli` to `rust_tree_sitter::cli`

## Technical Details
- **Issue**: The main binary (`target/release/rust_tree_sitter`) was not configured to use CLI module
- **Root Cause**: `main.rs` was missing CLI.parse() and command execution logic
- **Solution**: Modified main.rs to initialize clap CLI parser and execute commands through the Execute trait

## Impact
- Both binaries now work correctly:
  - `target/release/tree-sitter-cli wiki .` (recommended CLI binary)
  - `target/release/rust_tree_sitter wiki .` (also works after fix)
- Wiki generation functionality verified working (184 pages generated successfully)

## Testing Verification
- Built both binaries without errors
- Tested CLI help functionality
- Verified wiki generation works for current directory
- Wiki site contains proper structure with index, symbols, and documentation pages

## Files Modified
- `src/main.rs` - Added CLI functionality
- Generated wiki files (ignored by .gitignore)

## Result
The user can now successfully run wiki generation commands using either binary, and the CLI functionality is fully operational.
