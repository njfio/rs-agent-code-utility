# Enhanced Wiki Feature Expansion Plan

## Current Capabilities
- Static website generation from codebase analysis
- AI insights with mock/real providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, sequences, classes
- Symbol extraction and cross-references
- Search functionality (client-side)
- CLI interface for generation
- Multi-language support (Rust, JS, Python, C/C++, Go)

## Identified Gaps
- Limited complexity analysis integration
- Basic dependency graphs (no real import analysis)
- Security analysis limited to OWASP/taint with tree-sitter
- No performance analysis integration
- No advanced refactoring suggestions built-in
- Missing function-level enhancement features
- Limited AI context and knowledge graph integration
- No intelligence-driven documentation improvement

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Analysis Integration
1. Extend WikiConfig with new flags for enhanced features
2. Add complexity analysis integration (use existing ComplexityAnalyzer)
3. Add performance analysis metrics to file pages
4. Enhanced dependency graph with actual import analysis
5. Add security vulnerability explanations with AI

### Phase 2: Rich Function Documentation
1. Implement function-level AI enhancement
2. Add docstring improvement suggestions
3. Context-aware documentation generation
4. Multi-provider AI support with fallbacks

### Phase 3: Advanced Visualizations
1. Interactive diagrams with Mermaid enhancements
2. CFG-based control flow visualization
3. Call sequence improvements with more accurate analysis
4. Hybrid flowchart + sequence diagrams

### Phase 4: Knowledge Integration
1. Integrate with semantic graph builder
2. Add reasoning engine context
3. Implement knowledge persistence
4. Smart documentation diff and update capabilities

### Phase 5: CLI and Plugin Enhancement
1. Extended CLI flags for new features
2. Plugin integration for extensibility
3. Configuration file support
4. Incremental update capability

## Technical Implementation Details

### Analysis Extensions
- Leverage `ComplexityAnalyzer` for code metrics
- Use `SecurityAnalyzer` with AI explanations
- Integrate `PerformanceAnalyzer` for optimization insights
- Apply `ReasoningEngine` for intelligent insights

### AI Feature Additions
- Function-specific documentation enhancement
- Security vulnerability explanations
- Refactoring suggestion integration
- Quality assessment visualization

### Visualization Improvements
- Enhanced Mermaid diagrams with interactivity
- Better CFG representation
- Improved sequence diagram accuracy

## Integration Points
- `analyzer.rs`: New analysis capabilities
- `ai/features/`: Enhanced AI documentation
- `complexity_analysis.rs`: Wiki integration
- `security/*`: Vulnerability explanations
- `performance_analysis.rs`: Optimization suggestions
- `semantic_graph.rs`: Knowledge representation
- `reasoning_engine.rs`: Contextual insights

## CLI Extensions
- `--enhanced-ai`: Enable advanced AI processing
- `--security-insights`: Include vulnerability explanations
- `--refactoring-hints`: Add improvement suggestions
- `--function-enhancement`: Enable rich function docs
- `--knowledge-integration`: Use semantic graph
- `--incremental`: Only update changed files

This plan maintains backward compatibility while providing significant feature enhancements through optional configuration flags.
